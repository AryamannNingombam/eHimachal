Generally speaking Islam is prevalent in the west, Hinduism in the southern ranges of the eastern Himalaya, and Buddhism in the northern ranges of the western Himalaya. While there are numerous languages spoken, Hindi/Urdu (when written, they are two totally different languages, when spoken they are nearly interchangeable) will take you very far, as it is understood by the majority in the Pakistani, and Indian Himalaya. In Nepal it's not very useful, but it does have significant overlap with Nepali, and as such gives you a head start with that language.</p>\r\n<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>\r\n<p>The diversity of wildlife in the himalayas is huge. In the lower ranges, tigers, leopards, and the one horned rhinocerous can be found while the higher altitudes support a smaller but more unique group of animals. These include the snow leopard, Markhor goat, argali, and red panda.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Culture</h1>\r\n<p>The Himalayan population belongs to distinct cultural isolated indigenous Himalayan population. Those cultures &ndash; Hindu (Indian), Buddhist (Tibetan), <a title=\"Islam\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\">Islamic</a> (<a title=\"Afghanistan\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a>&ndash;<a title=\"Iran\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\">Iranian</a>) and Animist (Burmese and <a title=\"Southeast Asia\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia\">southeast Asian</a>) &ndash; have created here their own individual and unique place.</p>\r\n<p>There are many cultural aspects of the Himalayas. In <a title=\"Jainism\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism\">Jainism</a>, Mount Ashtapad in Himalayas is a sacred place where the first Jain <a title=\"Tirthankara\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirthankara\">Tirthankara</a>, <a title=\"Rishabhanatha\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabhanatha\">Rishabhdeva</a> attained <a title=\"Moksha\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha\">moksha</a>. It is believed that after <a title=\"Rishabhanatha\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabhanatha\">Rishabhdeva</a> attained <em><a title=\"Nirvana\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana\">nirvana</a></em>, his son, Emperor <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bharata Chakravartin\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Chakravartin\">Bharata Chakravartin</a>, had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tirthankaras\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirthankaras\">Tirthankaras</a> with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it <em>Sinhnishdha</em>.For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavath, the father of the goddess Parvati.The Himalayas is also considered to be the father of the river Ganges. Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus is the temple complex in <a title=\"Pashupatinath Temple\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupatinath_Temple\">Pashupatinath</a> and <a title=\"Muktinath\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muktinath\">Muktinath</a>, also known as Saligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called saligrams.</p>\r\n<p>The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Buddhists\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhists\">Buddhists</a> also lay a great deal of importance on the mountains of the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where <a title=\"Buddhism\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism\">Buddhism</a> started in <a title=\"Bhutan\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan\">Bhutan</a>.The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or<em>mahasiddhas</em>. They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa. The Himalayan people's diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing.The shapes and materials of the people's homes reflect their practical needs and the beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place a great importance on jewellery. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewellery.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Things To Do</h1>\r\n<p>Trekking is the most popular activity, with a wide selection of possibilities, from deserts to jungles. It's also popular to study Yoga or Meditation. White Water Rafting is popular in many places.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Stay safe</h1>\r\n<p>In general the Himalayas have fewer dangers than the more densely populated plains around them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Malaria is only an issue in the areas of low elevation, as the mosquito that carries the disease is not able to live at higher elevations. Take precautions when traveling threw areas of lower elevation, especially the neighboring plains.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a title=\"Altitude sickness\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Altitude_sickness\">Altitude sickness</a>is a worry, with many of the passes in the Himalaya being over 5000m. Increase your elevation as slowly as possible, avoid flying from a low elevation to a high one, and physical activity; and drink lots of liquids after gaining altitude. Altitude sickness is unpredictable, and may strike people who haven't had problems before. Give yourself lots of flexibility in your plans, to avoid pushing yourself higher when you need to rest.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stay up to date with the news, and be willing to change your plans, when going to places such as Kashmir, that are facing armed uprisings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Traffic on the narrow roads is often frightening, but due to the slow speeds is less likely to result in fatalities than on the roads of the plains.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Yetis frequent the Himalayas, use extreme caution!</li>\r\n</ul>", "tag": "The World's Rooftop", "population": 0, "male_pc": 0, "female_pc": 0, "total_educated": 0, "male_educated": 0, "female_educated": 0, "is_in_homepage": true, "content_credit": "https://wikitravel.org/en/Himalayas", "show_demographics": false, "show_hotels": false, "show_video": true, "show_images": true, "category": [1, 3]}}, {"model": "ehimachalapp.destination", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Shimla", "description": "<h1>Orientation</h1>\r\n<p>Sitting majestically above the searing plains, the British designated the town as the summer capital of India.

The British acquired five hills &mdash; <em>Kathalagh, Potreyn, Terah</em> (now called Moti Tibba by the locals), <em>Bakrota</em> and <em>Bhangora</em> &mdash; from the ruler of the Chamba State for developing the area as a sanatorium; in return, his taxes were reduced. The project originated with Lt. Col. Napier, then Chief Engineer of Punjab; (&lsquo;afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala&rdquo;). Dr. Clemenger of the 49th Native infantry did the surveying. In 1851 a spot where the Dayan Kund Ridge (now Dain Kund) breaks in to spurs was selected for the project and Kathalagh was identified for the construction of Convalescent Depot.</p>\r\n<p>The English visited this place for their summer vacations. The bungalows here are all made in the English style. The modern town is situated among the five hills, facing the Pir Panjal range of snow-capped and pristine mountains, surrounded by thick forests of pine and deodar trees.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Places To Visit</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Khajjiar</strong> - A stunning valley with a spring in the middle, while being quite beautiful, it gets littered with trash in the peak season of July when a massive number of tourists come. Known as the 'Switzerland of India' for the meadowy look.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Dainkund Walk</strong> - The road to Daikund takes away to the right side from the KalaTop toll booth . It is a 4 hour drive up to the check post barrier of an Air Force base. You have to park the car here. There is a 1/2 km , steep walk upto a observation hut. It offers spectacular view of the Dhauladhar ranges. Bypassing this hut, one needs to follow a relatively easy walk along the ridge for another 1 km to reach temple of goddess Kali. For the religious minded , this is a good stopover as there is a lot of sentiment attached to this temple by the locals. For the not-so-religious minded, the point offers even more spectacular view of Kailash Parbat of Dhaula Dhar ranges (not to be confused with Kailash Parbat of Kailash Mansarover fame, which is in Tibet)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Alah Water Tank</strong> - The main water tank in the area, holding 100,000 gallons.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Upper Bakrota</strong> - The highest area in Dalhousie, it has a number of estates, a residential school, and an Army barracks at the top. The area is circled by a road called Bakrota Walk, on the way to Khajjiar which ends at Alah Water Tank. It was the preferred destination of the landed gentry of Punjab during the Raj, now populated by similar residents from the new India. Some of the houses are worth seeing, but are mostly on private gated estates.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Kala Tope Rest House</strong> - On way to Khajjiar and 11 km from Dalhousie you come upon the toll booth which marks the entry to Kalatop wildlife sanctuary. To the left side, is the start of a 3 km gradual sloping upward path to the Kalatop forest guest house. The road is not a tar road but is motorable . You can drive the car right up to the guest house for a fee of Rs 200. But it is preferred that one walks down as you enjoy the walk through the dense pine forest. Kalatope rest house is made up of log woods and present a very quaint view of cottage nestled amongst lush green forest all around.The cottage has two cabins reserved for VIPs while another three cabins cater for normal tourists. It is advisable one spend a night in these cottage also to get the experience of night in a forest. The booking is quite cheap (Rs 800/- per day) and controlled by the forest officer at Chamba. The local guides claim that this cottage has served as venue for shooting for many Bollywood movies, latest being Ranvir Singh flick \"Lootera\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ganji Pahadi Walk</strong> - It is called Ganji Pahadi (<em>ganji</em> means bald, <em>pahadi</em> means hill) because there are no trees on the summit of the hill and it looks like it's got a bald patch at the top. You can ask a local how to get there. It is a long walk of at least an hour, but quite pleasant.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Subhash Chowk</strong> - This is the spot (<em>chowk</em> means intersection) where the road from the bus stand makes a cross road between two roads to G.P.O. and the one coming in from the bus stand. It is also a fairly active market, second to G.P.O.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Church</strong> - It is right next to the post office and police post in G.P.O.There are two other churches too. But none offer service now</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Chamba</strong> - It is a major district town a little distance away from Dalhousie and is the seat of the former princely State of Chamba. It has a number of attractions including a major museum, restaurants, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Kalatop wild life reserve. Kalatop Sanctuary was recognized as a game sanctuary on July 1, 1949. It lies between Dalhousie and Chamba at the northwestern extremity Daula Dhar. Dalhousie-Chamba Road runs through the sanctuary, which contains about 15 villages. In 1982-1983, there was a total of 1766 people living inside the sanctuary. This reserve covers an area of 3069 hectares. Its altitude varies from 1185 meters to 2768 meters (3910 ft-9134 ft.) The terrain is steep and typical of the Outer Himalayas. It is drained by several tributaries of the Ravi River which lies just to the north. There is a lake at Khajjiar. The temperature varies from -10&deg;C to 35&deg;C. The mean precipitation is 2648 mm, one-fourth of which falls as snow. Khajjiar, Kalatop, Dain Kund, Lakarmandi, and Bara Pathar are the tourist attractions that fall in this sanctuary. From Gandhi Chowk, a steep, uphill walk will take you to the scenic Bakrota Circle. After walking about 2 kilometers, the road to this sanctuary starts near the Municipal Water Resivoir. Kalatop is at an altitude of 2440 meters, and it is 8.5 kilometers from the GPO. From Lakarmandi, a jeepable road through the dense forest leads to the Kalatop Forest Resthouse. This is a perfect spot for a weekend retreat. The panoramic views of Pir Panjal Range and countryside are breathtaking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Ask the locals for more detailed directions and advice about these places. Dain Kund, Upper Bakrota, and Ganji Pahadi are the lesser-known but quite long and enjoyable walks. Pack a picnic basket: there are a lot of open, empty spots where one can sit and enjoy a meal and a good view.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Things To Do</h1>\r\n<p>Dalhousie is known for its great valleys and high mountain ranges. Places like Panchpula are known for trekking. There are waterfalls, places to trek, or to sit down, relax, and experience nature. It is 5 km from G.P.O. Dalhousie Chowk. Going there is easy by bus, taxi, etc., but going on foot is a marvellous experience. This Place Registered its Name in History. As here Lies the Memorial of Amar Ajit Singh (Uncle of Shaheed Bhagat Singh)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Go to the Tibetan market and have a look around just for fun.</li>\r\n<li>Enjoy long walks; carry an umbrella if its cloudy.</li>\r\n<li>Picnics are the thing to do in Dalhousie.</li>\r\n<li>Have a barbeque if your hotel has the facilities to do so.</li>\r\n<li>Star-gaze: the sky is exceptionally clear in Dalhousie at night (bring your binoculars/telescope).</li>\r\n<li>Enjoy a ride on the ponies in Khajjiar.</li>\r\n<li>Trek: it's a fantastic place to trek.</li>\r\n</ul>", "tag": "", "population": 7051, "male_pc": 54, "female_pc": 46, "total_educated": 91, "male_educated": 95, "female_educated": 87, "is_in_homepage": true, "content_credit": "https://wikitravel.org/en/Dalhousie", "show_demographics": true, "show_hotels": true, "show_video": true, "show_images": true, "category": [2, 3]}}, {"model": "ehimachalapp.destination", "pk": 6, "fields": {"name": "Kasauli", "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><em><strong>About Kasauli</strong></em></h1>\r\n<p><strong>Kasauli</strong> is a small town in the state of <a title=\"Himachal Pradesh\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Himachal_Pradesh\">Himachal Pradesh</a> located at an altitude of 1,927 m. The town is 77 km from Shimla and 70 km from Chandigarh. Legend says that it came into existence after Lord Hanuman placed his feet here in order to advance on to the Sanjeevani hill. The place where the lord actually kept his feet is believed to be at a hillock which is 300 m high.</p>\r\n<p>Historically, Kasauli is one of those hill stations that was developed by the British Empire during its peak period in India. It is one of those places that, despite its beauty still has yet to find itself prominently on the tourist's map. In fact, it is very good for all those who yearn to spend some time alone with their family or, for that matter, even themselves.</p>\r\n<p>If you happen to visit the town during the off-season (November to February), it is quite likely that you will not come across any person for a long while on your walk. Still, you will be accompanied on your walk by the sweet and soothing voices of the birds along with the gentle rustling of leaves.</p>\r\n<p>For those who are quite the opposite and look for fun and adventure at every step, Kasauli will be a disappointment as there is hardly anything to do. There are some small attractions within and around the town that will keep you somewhat busy.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1><strong>Places To See</strong></h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Gurudwara Shri Guru Nanakji</strong> This historic Sikh gurudwara is located in Gharkhal bazaar on the main road towards Kasauli, having also lodging facilities. Besides the daily prayers, a programme is held every Sunday morning. Another Sikh gurudwara is located on the other side of the Kasauli ridge on the Kasauli&ndash;Mashobra (old Hindustan&ndash;Tibet) Road near the Air Force Radar Station.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sunset Point</strong> is situated about 1.5 km from the bus stand. The Sunset point offers a magnificent view of the nearby hill regions, and of plains Chandigarh, Panchkula, Mohali, Kalka, Pinjore, Parwanoo, Baddi and Nalagarh all are visible as an eagle eye view from this 270 degree view point. The Sunset point has a small cafeteria which serves freshly prepared items viz sandwiches, burgers, popcorns, corn on the cob, milk shakes, tea, coffee but doesn't promote cold drinks, chips or namkeens. The evening bar-be-cue is a must not miss if you are a non vegetarian; must try their smoked chicken.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Manki Point</strong> This is the highest point in Kasauli, the place where Lord Hanuman is believed to have set his feet while on his way to look for the Sanjeevani <em>buti</em> (herb). Around 4 km from the Kasauli bus stand, at its top, is a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman that lies within the premises of the Air Force base. As such, there are a few restrictions: one is not allowed to carry bags or cameras inside. The hike upto the temple can be a bit difficly for those who are not used to climbing, but it is worth the effort. The views from atop the hill are simply magnificent if the day is clear. You can watch the brilliant sparkle of the Sutlej river as it makes its way through the plains, and the pure beauty of the snow-capped peaks of the Dhauladhar Range. Signing of the route starts from the Church.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Christ Church</strong> Close to the bus stand, it was constructed by the British family that founded the town of Kasauli itself. It is a magnificent structure built in the shape of a cross. Set amidst a grove of chestnut and fir trees, it is a place of worship for around 30 families. Apart from them, many tourists also flock here. Earlier, the church was known as the Anglican Church. In 1970, it was brought under the aegis of the CNI (Church of North India) and is currently managed by the diocese of Amritsar.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>Things To Do</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Hike</strong> Kasauli has many outdoor trails where one can experience the natural serenity. Some of the better round-trip ones are located off Upper Mall Road and originate near the BSNL quarters located within the Indian Army premises. One such trail leads to Hanuman Point. There are other trails on the Lower Mall that will take you towards Gharkhal. The trails are safe and easy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The main trail to Monkey Point leads through the Air Force Guard Station at the end of Lower Mall and one is required to register here first.

It was from this place that Padam Sambhava, a zealous teacher &amp; Buddhist missionary left for Tibet to preach his new doctrine of Buddhism. The Hindus believe that it was here that Rishi Lomas did his penance in devotion to Lord Shiva. Rewalsar is important to the Sikhs who have a Gurudwara built in commemoration of Guru Gobind Singh's visit to this place. It is a very sacred place for the Bhutanese, who are following this doctrine of religion as their State Religion.

A trek route through thick forests links Barot to Kullu.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shikari Devi</strong>-Trekking Paths through woods of assorted trees and shrubs-which include several medicinal herbs-two seperate trek routes lead up to this ancient shrine which crowns the top of a hill. Hunters in the area once prayed to the goddess for success in their hunt and here perhaps, lies the origin of the name \"Shikari Devi\". The goddess is worshipped in the form of a stone image. Interestingly, the temple which is said to have been in existence since the time of the Pandavas, has no roof, for local legend has it, that all attempts to build one have been unsuccessful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jhatingri</strong>-It is situated on Ghogar Dhar at an elevation of 6,600 feet.

It offers trekking up to 3300 metres to shikari mata peak. it has several others trek routes but the place suffers due to apathy of government.

It is in ruin now. The state was called Kahlur till such time the seat of Government was shifted to Bilaspur. Among the local population the district is still known as Kahlur. The fort is a square structure built of stones, each side about thirty meters long and as much high. Its walls are about two metres thick. It has two storeys each about fifteen metres high. The floor of the second storey, supported on numerous high stone pillars. About twelve meters above the floor of the second storey there were certain window shaped places with small peeping holes for the garrison to reconnoitre and, if need be to shoot at besiegers. Most of these hollows have now been closed with cement or iron-mesh. Within the fort, in the upper storey, is a small temple to Naina Devi with a stone idol. There are seven small ancient fortresses in the district at Bacchretu, Bahadurpur, Basseh, Fatehpur, Sariyun, Swarghat and Tiun. Sunhani is small village on the bank of Seer Khad is yet another place which claims the distinction of being a state headquarters for some period.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Fort of Bahadurpur</strong>, (On the top of Bahadurpur hill, the highest point (1,980 m) in the district, near Tepra Village in Paragana Bahadurpur Tehsil Sadar, about 40 km from Bilaspur) - The range derives its name from the Bahadurpur fort. Due to its comparatively greater height it receives occasional snow fall in winter. The range is embellished by a beautiful small wood of deodar and ban trees. Almost in the centre of this range, in picturesque surroundings, is perched a rest-house. The fort is said to have been built by Raja Keshab Chand (c A.D. 1620). It is just 6 km above Namhol. From this high place the Ratanpur Fort, Swarghat, the Fatehpur Fort, the Naina Devi hill, plains near Ropar and the mountains of Shimla can be seen and look beautiful. Baron Charles Hugel, a German traveler, passing through Bilaspur in 1835 has left on record a vivid picture of this fort. It is, therefore, obvious from the account that this fort was built prior to 1835, but now is in its ruins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Fort of Sariun</strong>, (To the eastern side of the Tiun range, on the lifty range and peak of Sariun, at an elevation of about 1,500 m, about 58 km from Bilaspur) - Played its usual role in the struggle between the erstwhile State of Bilaspur and Kangra during the minority rule of Mohan Chand. Nothing now remains of the fort except its ruin. It appears to be rectangular edifice made of stones. Its main gate faces west. From the relics it can be said that the fort was about twelve meters high. The thickness of the walls is about one metre. Within its walls a part of the area is marked by the ruins of what might be once the living rooms numbering about fifteen. The walls of the fort contain places shaped like a window with certain holes across the wall to facilitate showering of lead upon the besiegers. Tradition holds that the fort was originally built by the same Raja of the erstwhile Suket State and was subsequently wrested by the ruler of Bilaspur, the local people entertain a superstition according to which, the stones once forming part of the Fort are not used in any residential building.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Fort of Tiun</strong>, (On the top of a hill known as the Tiun range, 17 km in length, at distance of about 45 km from Bilaspur, on the Ali Khad crossing Ghumarwin-Ladraur motorable road, about 10 km from Ghumarwin proper). Relics of this fort still serves to remind of the ancient turbulent times when wars in this area were perhaps a routine feature. Raja Kahn Chand got it constructed in 1142 Vikrami. The area of the fort around 14 hectare. It is rectangle in shape. The length of the fort was 400 meters with a breadth 200 meters. The height of the wall is varies from 2 meters to 10 meters. The main gate of the fort is 3 meters height and 5 and a 1/2 meters breadth. There were two water tanks inside the fort. Also there were two granary which contains 3000 kg grain. The fort is said to have once served as a prison to an uncle of Raja Kharak Chand.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Fort of Bachhretu</strong>, (In Kot Hill, on the western slope of Kotdhar just 3 km southward to Shahtalai, it is 3000 ft above sea level) - Magnificent and sweeping view of Gobind Sagar and the surrounding hills. The fort was constructed by Raja Ratan Chand of Bilaspur who ruled from 1355 to 1406. Obviously the relics are as old as about six hundred years and indicate that the stronghold was of a rectangular shape, the longer arms about 100 metres and shorter about 50 meters, built of hammer-dressed stones. From the portions of the enclosing walls, still existing here and there, it can be assumed to have been about 20 meters in height. The thickness of its walls must have been one metre tapering towards the top. The space inside was, perhaps, divided into numerous room-shaped compartments out of which about fifteen can be traced even now. Walls of one of the room are exceedingly high, measuring about ten to twelve metres. A water tank is also said to have existed. A very interesting small temple, housing two busts of the goddess Asht Bhuja (eight armed) and some other deities is still extant. A pipal tree has now grown within the fort.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Other</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Thakurdwara of Sunhani</strong>, (On the bank of Seer Khad, just 3 km behind Barthin, on Bhager- Barthi &amp; Ghumarwin road, just 8 km from Ghumarwin) - Shunhani is very attractive and historical place. Raja Vikram Chand (1555-1593 AD) made Sunhani its capital this area got the credit of being Kehloor's capital for more than 100 years. Chandel kings have a tradition that where ever they went &amp; settled, they constructed temple of Nahar Singh Ji (Nar Singh Devta) and worshiped the deity. According to this tradition they made Thakurdwara of Sunhani where they made Narsingh Devta (there Istdev) temple. On the doors of thakurdwara, there is Gupta period architecture &amp; drawing. There are many jarokhas on the backside of thakurdwara where sculptures of various gods and goddesses are made. Today also, people of this area offer new harvest as Nasrawan. Buffalo milk&rsquo;s ghee is firstly offered here newly married couple move around Ficus (Pipple) tree. Shitla Mata&rsquo;s temple is present near it though now this region is not that famous, its popularity still persists.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Thakurdwara of Auhar</strong>, (In the middle of the district Bilaspur) - It was an important town of the princely state Bilaspur. Due to its importance Rani Naggar Dei built the famous Thakurdwara of Auhar. She also constructed on water tank with roof known as chhatwain and an inn for the stay of the travelers. In the Thakurdwara idols of &lsquo;Shaligram&rsquo; and &lsquo;Narsingha&rsquo; were installed. The walls of the temple have beautiful mural paintings. The Language and Culture department has given financial assistance for the repair of the Thakurdwara.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bhakra Dam</strong>, ( In Naina Devi Sub-Tehsil about 14 km from Nangal town ) - The highest straight gravity dam in the world occupies the predominant position amongst the places of tourist interest. The idea for the construction of this dam was conceived by Sir Louis Dane the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, who travelled from Sunni to Bilaspur and then onward to Ropar. The project could not make headway due to prohibitive cost of construction. In the year 1938-39 the districts of Rohtak and Hissar of the then Punjab State experienced severe drought resulting in great loss of human life and cattle. The scheme was again mooted out but was not executed due to second world war. It was only after independence in March, 1948 that the work was taken in hand for execution. On the historic day of 17th November, 1955 later Prime Minister Shri Jawahar Lal Nehru placed the first bucket of concrete at the foundation. The constructin of dam was completed in October, 1962. The height of the dam is 226 metres, length at the top is 518 metres and width 9 metres. It has a length of 99 metres at the bottom and width 402 metres. The project derives its name from two villages Bhakhra and Nangal situated on the foot hills of the low Himalayan ranges. Bhakhra occupies a very important place on the India&rsquo;s tourist map and has rightly been described as a &ldquo;New Temple of Resurgent India&rdquo;, by the late Prime Minister Mr. Nehru. The project authorities have set up a Public Relation Office in Nangal Township which provides necessary help and guidance to the tourists.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Gobind Sagar Lake</strong> , (On river Sutlej) - Has been created by the huge hydel dam at Bhakra and is named in honour of Gobind Singh the Tenth Sikh guru. One of the world's highest gravity dams, the Bhakra rises 225.5 m above its lowest foundations. Under the supervision of the famous American dam-builder, Harvey Slocum, work began in 1955 and was completed in 1962. Incidentally, Slocum had no formal training as an engineer, but his conceptions and designs have proven successful. To maintain the level of water, the flow of river Beas was also channeled to Gobind Sagar by the Beas-Sutlej link which was completed in 1976. Today, this dam feeds electricity and water to a large area the Gobind Sagar reservoir is 90 km long and encompasses an area of approximately 170 sq km. There are provisions for water sports speed boats and ferry rides. In October and November, when the water level of the reservoir is at its peak, a series of regattas are also organizing by the department of Tourism and Civil Aviation. Water-skiing, sailing, kayaking and water scooter racing are popular water sports activities during this period.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>New Bilaspur Town</strong> - The old Bilaspur town, has now been submerged in the Govind Sagar, was founded in year 1663 when the capital of the state was shifted from Sunhani to this place, it was situated on the south east side of the Satluj. New Bilaspur Town is situated just above the old town of Bilaspur at a height of 670 metres above the mean sea level. The New Township Bilaspur has been conceived, planned and built on modern lines and should be regarded as the first planned hill town of the country. The new planned township, 64 km from Kiratpur on the Manali National Highway No. 21, has come up which is the seat of district headquarters. The pleasure of a visit will be enhanced manifold when a motor launch is preferred as the means of travel, gliding through cool and enchanting waters of the lake. The best months from visiting this place are from September to December. The Nalwari or Annual cattle fair is held at Bilaspur for four or five days in March months, the occasion is marked by wrestling and other amusements. A good trade is usually done. Cattle are brought from Nalagarh and neighboring parts of Punjab sell over here. It is easily approachable as regular bus services are maintained from and to Shimla, Mandi, Hamirpur and Chandigarh. The places of interest were the temples of Sri Naina Devi Ji, Raghu Nath Ji, Gopal Ji, Khanmukheshwar and Deomati where fairs are held.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Kandrour Bridge</strong> , (8 kilometres from Bilaspur on National Highway No-88, across the river Satluj). Very beautiful and fascinating bridge. Its construction was started in April,1959 and was completed in 1965. The total cost of construction came to Rs. 28,12,998. The span of the bridge is about 280 meters with a breadth of about seven meters and the height above the lowest river bed below is about 80 meters, making it one of the highest bridge in the world. It is ranked first in Asia for its height. It has provided a link between Bilaspur, Ghumarwin and Hamirpur district, and is a marvellous engineering feat. The pillars supporting the bridge are hollowed. The bridge was opened by Shri Raj Bahadur, Minister of Transport in 1965.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Deoli Fish Farm</strong>, ( 15 km from New Bilaspur township towards Mandi just below the Shimla-Mandi Road ) - Comprising 4.4 hectares comes in existence 1962. It consists of two big brood stock tanks and 14 nursery ponds. The total outlay on setting up this hatchery was 3.68 lacks. In beginning the farms activities were limited to meet the seed stocking requirements of Gobind Sagar reservoir, but its targets were increased year to year and research, training, technique and demonstration brought under the farm programmed. During 1978 fish species being record at the farm were demonstrated to the people by constructing a small aquarium and its aim was to apprise the popular. During 1989 a training center and Hostel were constructed within the farm premises so that training course be imparted to the departmental personnel and interested fish farmers. Now training camps are being conducted with modern fish breeding and culture technique training are imparted. This farm has not only historic importance but is can be known as a center breeding excellent training in fish culture and research programmed. Keeping in view the commendable work done in the field of breeding, the Punjab University extended its recognition for undertaking research work at this farm. The Deoli fish farm has played a major role in breeding fish population in Gobind Sagar reservoir, income of the reservoir fishermen and their lives prosperous. For the first time Silver Carp fish was stocked in Gobind Sagar reservoir from Deoli farm. Every year 30-40 lacks mirror carp fingerlings are being produced at the farm and these are stocked in Gobind Sagar reservoir and other water bodies in the State and distributed to the private fish farms. Due to regular stocking in Gobind Sagar reservoir for the last decade at has a unique capacity of fish production per hectare in the country and this credit goes to Deoli farm. The scientists of ICAR and State Fisheries Department initiated a joint research project viz. &lsquo;Genetic Rejuvenation of Fish Stock in HP&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Bio-Science Department&rsquo; started this project entire funded about 18.00 lacks. A quality strain of fish is being reared under this project and distributed to the fish farmers. Under this technique demonstration programme a new scheme namely &lsquo;Fish Culture in Running Water&rsquo; was introduced for the first time at the farm. This scheme was observed suitable especially in high altitude of Himachal Pradesh on the basis of success of this technique the Govt of India incorporated this scheme under the Centrally Sponsored Fish Farmers&rsquo; Development Agency subsidy programme. The NABARD Bank has also approved this scheme namely &lsquo;Fish Culture in Running Water&rsquo; which resulted in setting up of about 1000 units in the State. In recent years sport fisheries is fostering in the Gobind Sagar reservoir which clearly indicates vast potential of attracting tourists. The Deptt regularly organizes angling completions every year. In Gobind Sagar and Mahseer fish which is a famous and most liked fish of the anglers is an important fish of this reservoir. As the breeding of Mahseer fish is not a easy job hence the Punjab University and State Fisheries Department jointly prepared a project of Rs. 19.00 lacks it was got approved from ICAR. Present hatchery set up at the Deoli farm has been constructed under this scheme. Under this scheme matured Mahseer fish would be brought from his habitat and bred in comfortable situation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Namhol</strong>, (About 24 km from Bilaspur and 68 km from Shimla on the Bilaspur-Shimla motorable road on which regular bus service is maintained) - Small hamlet. There is a Thakurdwar which was built by Raja Amar Chand in 1883 A.D. Brass idols of Ram, Lakshman, Sita and Hanuman are installed in the temple. The place is the main centre of ginger trade. There are a Police Post, a Senior Secondary School, an Ayurvedic Dispensary, a Branch Post Office, a State Bank of India and a PWD Rest House.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Things To Do</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Para-gliding </strong> - Before the year 1994, there was hardly any para-gliding or hang gliding pilot in Himachal Pradesh, excepting one, Roshan Lal Thakur from Manali, who had acquired some skill in flying from foreign pilots, often visiting Manali as tourist. Mean while R.P. Gautam who had come on retirement from Central Reserve Police Force as Commandant, visualised the vast potential in paragliding from Bandla mountain. To make his dream come true, he got in contact with Shakti Singh Chandel, the then Director Tourism and Civil Aviation, to extend all possible help to promote paragliding not only in Bilaspur, but also in whole in Himachal Pradesh. The Director Tourism, who himself belonged to Bilaspur, took keen interest in approving Bandla top as take off site, gave financial assistance to run para gliding courses for Bilaspur under Himachal Aero Adventure Institute Bilaspur, which under expert guidance of Mr. Bruce Mills from New Zealand and Alexi Garisimov from Russia,Vikram Sharma the Local Pilot got the pilots trained. Thus Bilaspur was brought on World Map in Paragliding. What is special about Bilaspur, which is not there in flying sites at other places, is that it gives you almost eight hours of flying time as against 3 to 4 hours maximum at Billing or Manali. More over it has vast and safe landing grounds on the bank of Govind Sagar Lake at LUHNU. From training point of view, Bilaspur can be considered the best in whole of Asia. It is laid down in the training manual that training in instability maneuvers during advance pilot course i.e. Dynamic Stall, deep stall, spiral drive, spin reovery, assymmetric tuck, front tuck and deployment of Reserve Parachute, should be carried out over a broad base of water for reasons. For this, there is hardly any place, where there is any huge lake just beside the landing site. Bilaspur has the privilege of having unique combination of Air Sports in one stretch, which is very rare.Local contact person for paragliding in Bilaspur is Vikram Sharma (Sonu) one may contact him any time at his mail id vikramsharma003@gmail.com.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Water and River Sports</strong> - Govind Sagar reservoir in Bilaspur (H.P.) with its 56 km length and nearly 3 km breadth, offers a variety of water sports activities in close collaboration with the Directorate tourism and Civil Aviation and Directorate of Mountaineering and Allied Sports. Due to fluctuating level of Lake here, the water sports are mainly confined to half of the year i.e. August to January. During this period the activities include swimming, surfing, water-skiing, Kayaking, rowing, canoeing, white water river rafting. Three level of courses are also conducted &ndash; beginners, intermediate and advance. For this tourism department of Himachal Pradesh has constructed a huge water sports complex with all the boarding, lodging and equipment facilities. River rafting or white water rafting, as it is also called, is swiftly making Bilaspur a focus for this scintillating sport. For a torrent of adrenaline to gush through every vein and surge cover every muscle, you can race over the rapids of river &ndash; Sutlej, right from Rampur to Bilaspur through serpentine path in deep gorges, placid mountains, green alpine meadows and thick forests, all forming an immense spectrum. Non swimmers and novice can also have this thrilling experience in an inplatable rubber dinghy, on some of the gentler rapids. Earnest efforts are on to harness the vast potential in water sports to bring Bilaspur (H.P.) on the world map.</li>\r\n</ul>", "tag": "India\u2019s First Planned Hill Station", "population": 13058, "male_pc": 56, "female_pc": 44, "total_educated": 91, "male_educated": 95, "female_educated": 91, "is_in_homepage": false, "content_credit": "https://wikitravel.org/en/Bilaspur_(Himachal_Pradesh)", "show_demographics": true, "show_hotels": true, "show_video": false, "show_images": true, "category": [3, 6]}}, {"model": "ehimachalapp.destination", "pk": 9, "fields": {"name": "Kasol", "description": "<h1>Understand</h1>\r\n<p>Popularly known as 'Mini Israel', Kasol is a beautiful village in <a title=\"Himachal Pradesh\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Himachal_Pradesh\">Himachal Pradesh</a>, northern India.

There are luxury buses run by HRTC from Delhi, Chandigarh, Manali &amp; many other main cities, but depending upon weather and traffic conditions, bus services aren't regular like in metro cities. In Delhi, all Volvo buses by HRTC &amp; Himachal Tourism start from Himachal Bhavan which is located in Mandi House near Connaught Place.

The locals claim it to be one of the oldest democracies of the world with a well-organized parliamentary system, guided by their <em>devta</em> (deity) Jamlu rishi. Although Jamlu is currently identified with a sage from the Puranas, this is a relatively recent development. Jamlu is believed to have been worshipped in pre-Aryan times. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Penelope Chetwood\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_Chetwood\">Penelope Chetwood</a> recounts a tale about an orthodox Brahmin priest, who visited Malana, and tried to educate the locals about the pedigree of their god, and what subsequently befell the hapless priest.</p>\r\n<p>Malana has been called &lsquo;one of the oldest democracy&rsquo; in the world. The villagers believe that they have pure Aryan genes and that they are descendants of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s soldiers.</p>\r\n<p>A dam project, the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Malana Hydro Power Station (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malana_Hydro_Power_Station&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Malana Hydro Power Station</a>, has brought Malana much closer to the rest of the world and provides revenue for the region. A new road has shortened the walking time from several days to just 4 hours. The Hydro Malana Project has also ruined the beauty of the valley. In 2004, Malana was adopted by Aryan Sharma, a businessman based in Delhi. On 5 January 2008, a raging fire in the village, which burnt for more than 5 hours, destroyed cultural structures and parts of ancient temples located in the village. In 2017, the village ordered the closure of approximately a dozen guest houses and restaurants, ostensibly on the orders of the deity Jamlu.</p>\r\n<h2>Culture And Lifestyle</h2>\r\n<p>The village administration is democratic and is believed, by locals, to be the oldest republic of the world.</p>\r\n<p>Despite being a part of the <a title=\"Kullu\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullu\">Kullu</a> valley, there is a myth that the Malanis have very distinct physical features, and a dialect which is different from the rest of the valley. However, in the valleys of Himachal, there are a significant number of distinct Pahadi dialects, some of them totally different from each other. Hence the physical/lingual uniqueness cannot be proven, given the inaccessibility of the Malana people, except for the trade of Marijuana / Hashish in the Parvati valley.</p>\r\n<h3>Jamblu Devta</h3>\r\n<p>The social structure of Malana in fact rests on villagers' unshaken faith in their powerful deity, <a class=\"new\" title=\"Jamblu Devta (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jamblu_Devta&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Jamblu Devta</a>. The entire administration of the village is controlled by him through a village council. This council has eleven members and they are believed as delegates of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Jamblu (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jamblu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Jamblu</a> who govern the village in his name.

According to one of them, it is believed that they are the descendants of <a title=\"Greeks\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\">Greek</a> soldiers of <a title=\"Alexander the Great\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great\">Alexander's</a> army. As the legend goes, some soldiers took refuge in this remote land after Alexander left the country and later settled there permanently. This myth is however disputed because there are those who claim that it is the valley of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kalasha Desh\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalasha_Desh\">Kalash</a>, in Pakistan that is actually the area in which Alexander the Great's soldiers took refuge. This legend is also inconsistent with the legendary descent of the local people from Indo-Aryans who would pre-date Alexander the Great's soldiers by approximately a thousand years. Recent genetic typing of the Malani population is much more consistent with an Indo-Aryan origin with a large proportion of Y-DNA haplotypes J2 and R1a which are the haplotypes of majority of Indians, North or South in South Asia rather than with a Greek origin which would have a different characteristic mix of Y-DNA haplotypes such as R2b. J2 and R1a are paternal lineages found in more than 20% and 40% of population of North/South India but are rare in Mediterranean societies like Greece.</p>\r\n<h3>Temples</h3>\r\n<p>The village has several ancient temples.

Set against the backdrop of the Dhauladhar Range of the Indian Himalayas, the town is picturesque, although the rubbish-strewn roadsides and waterways of the Tibetan Colony (down the hill from Bir proper) are an unfortunate contrast to its golden roofed temples, and to the greenery of Upper Bir (Bir Proper) and the surrounding villages. The Tibetan Colony is actually in the village of Chowgan. Bir proper, sometimes referred to as \"Indian Bir\" or \"Upper Bir\", is the small market and surrounding farming community located in the foothills above Chowgan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The founding of Bir</strong>: Local accounts indicate that Bir was first settled by immigrants from Bengal around 1600 C.E. These families settled in Bir proper. Other groups migrated in much more recently, starting in the early 20th century C.E.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Tibetan Colony</strong>: In 1966 the third Neten Chokling (1928-1973), an incarnate lama of the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, brought his family and a small entourage to Bir. With the help of foreign aid Neten Chokling purchased over 200 acres of land and established a Tibetan settlement where 300 Tibetan families were given land to build houses. At this time Chokling Rinpoche also started building in Bir a new Neten monastery and disciples who had followed him into India formed its first sangha. When the third Chokling Rinpoche passed away in 1973, his eldest son, Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche (b 1951), assumed responsibility for completing his father&rsquo;s vision. The fourth Neten Chokling incarnation was born in 1973 in Bhutan and brought to Bir at a young age where the family of the third Chokling took him under their wings. In 2004 full responsibility for <strong>Pema Ewam Ch&ouml;gar Gyurme Ling Monastery</strong> in Bir was passed to the fourth Neten Chokling. The monastery, now a place of study and practice for over 120 monks, served as the setting for Khyentse Norbu&rsquo;s 1999 feature film &ldquo;The Cup.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Other Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Bir include: <strong>Palyul Ch&ouml;khorling Monastery</strong> (Nyingma) under the guidance of Rigo Tulku Rinpoche; <strong>Bir Dirru Monastery / Bir Sakya Lama Society</strong> under the guidance of the 15th Gyalsay Tulku Rinpoche and the 14th Dungyud Rinpoche; and <strong>Drikung Dozin Theckcho Ling Monastery</strong> (Drikung Kagyu) under guidance of Ont&uuml;l Rinpoche.</p>\r\n<p>A variety of information on the Bir-Billing area is available at the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://birhp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Bir Portal </a>, a community-supported online guide for visitors and residents of the greater Bir area.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1> Get in </h1>\r\n<h2> By bus </h2>\r\n<p>Bir is about four hours or so from <a class=\"new\" title=\"Dharamshala/McLeodGanj (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dharamshala/McLeodGanj&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Dharamshala/McLeodGanj</a>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>From Dharamshala</strong>: There are direct buses to Bir Road/Upper Bir leaving at 6am &amp; 2pm from Lower Dharamshala.

Only mode of transport is to hire a horse/mule, for which they charge your Rs.250 per person for Mahasu Peak or Rs.380 per person for Deshu peak depending on the package one choose (If u r good at bargaining then u can hire the horse/mule for Rs.50 per person). It is safe to hire the horse for the trip as the path is very muddy. Also, there will be photographers pestering you to hire them for shooting your memorable photos.

Situated on the Beas river (Vyaas in Hindi) and near its source, it is a popular tourist spot for Indians in summer and a magical, snow-covered place in winter. A staging point for a number of treks (Beas Kund, Chandrakhani Pass) and sports such as white-water rafting, Manali is also on the road to <a title=\"Ladakh\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Ladakh\">Ladakh</a> via the valley of <a title=\"Lahaul and Spiti\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Lahaul_and_Spiti\">Lahaul and Spiti</a> and the Rohtang Pass which is the main attraction near Manali.</p>\r\n<h2>Weather</h2>\r\n<p>Minimum temp could be below -5&deg;C from October 'thru March.

Also make sure the driver has made the trip at least once before and knows all the routes well. Also, you need to make sure that the driver is habituated to long, continuous driving routines. If you are going to Manali through Chandigarh-Ropar-Kiratpur-Mandi highway, then your driver would need to drive on hilly roads for at least 6 hours. Chandigarh to Manali would be about 8-9 hours by taxi.</p>\r\n<h2>By train</h2>\r\n<p>The nearest Broad Gauge Rail Head is Ambala Cantt (200km) or Chandigarh (250km)from Indian Capital New Delhi. Ambala Cantt is on the Delhi - Amritsar and Delhi - Jammu main lines and is well served by rail, but you will need to travel to Ambala to get a bus for the 10 hour ride to Manali. Jogindernagar and Kalka are other, less preferable, rail heads for Manali.</p>\r\n<p>The nearest broad gauge station is Kiratpur Sahib in Punjab near the city of Nangal. It lies in Ropar district of Punjab. The station lies on the Ambala Cantt - Una route of Indian Railways. From here you can easily get buses for Manali.</p>\r\n<h2>By plane</h2>\r\n<p>The nearest airport is Bhuntar ( Kullu ) Airport ( Tel: 01902-265037, 265603), 50km from Manali, 10km from <a title=\"Kullu\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Kullu\">Kullu</a>, about two hours away. Air India Regional operate flights to <a title=\"Kullu\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Kullu\">Kullu</a> from Delhi. However the services can be irregular, and airfares can be high. Himalyan Bulls offer flight services from Chandigarh to kullu airport. It can be booked from their <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://himalayanbulls.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">site</a>. From the airport the best option to go to Manali is by Pre Paid taxi which is easily available there. The taxi stand is 100 metres from the airport. They have written prices with minimum \u20b91200 to Manali. Alternatively just go to Kullu and take a frequent public bus (\u20b935, see Get Around section).</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Getting Around</h1>\r\n<p>There are various ways of getting around in Manali, if you are not already travelling with your own vehicle. Most tourists hire a taxi (various kinds available), which takes you around to all the sight-seeing spots in and around Manali (Rohtang, Manikaran etc). It costs about \u20b91,800 per day, or little over \u20b93,000 if you book together for 3 days (in the peak season). Dress for Rohtang cost around \u20b9150 for each set including boots and skiing set will cost you around \u20b9200. These detail are mentioned at a board at Mall Road. Be sure to bargain.</p>\r\n<p>The second most common way is to hire a motorbike. There are many places where you can hire a motorbike (easy to find if you ask around), and is the most common mode of transport for foreigners. Both cruiser bikes like Bullet and sport bikes from Honda, Bajaj, Yamaha etc are easily available, though Bullet is the most commonly seen one on the roads. Rates hover around \u20b91000-1500 per day in the peak season, but much discounted at other times. A good place worth a look will be in Bike rentals Manali office in Vashisht 9816044140, have a good selection of Royal Enfields and Pulsars. Also 'Tinku' Bike mechanic near old Manali bridge is an honest shop for bike rentals.</p>\r\n<p>Public transport is not so good. There are cheap bus services, but they are not so frequent. Yet, if you are going to stay for a long time, it is better to know the times and use them, as other modes of public transport are exorbitant compared to bus. For e.g., auto rickshaws take \u20b9200 from manali mall road to Solang valley, while the bus will cost you just \u20b910. The buses are not punctual specially because they seem not have a written schedule. The best option is to ask about timing at the bus terminal. Buses starts to run at 07:00. Frequently a bus can be cancelled or late. You can get in / out almost at any place on the route just wave to the driver.</p>\r\n<p>Public bus routes</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Kullu - Manali. Price \u20b940. Every 15min</li>\r\n<li>Manali - Naggar. Every 1.5h</li>\r\n<li>Manali - Solang. Every 1h</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Places To See</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Rohtang Pass</strong>, at an altitude of <strong>3979m</strong> (13,050 ft) above sea level, is another adventure tourist site where it can be cold even on a summer day. It is the highest point on the <strong>Manali-Keylong</strong> road and provides a wide panoramic view of mountains rising far above clouds, which is truly breath taking. Close by is a small lake called Dassaur Lake. Beas Kund, the source of river Beas, is also nearby. In winter, the road of Rothang Pass is closed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Important to note that the road to Rohtang Pass is closed off at Manali bridge, on all Tuesdays 09:00-18:00 for carrying out road widening work and repairs. If you are able to leave early, before 09:00, you can avoid the traffic rush (found on all other days) and have Rohtang Pass to your self (well almost!!). Flip side is to be prepared for stoppages (extending up to a few hours) on the return trip as the road is blocked off where repair works are progressed.</p>\r\n<p>If you are driving up, be prepared for the rough broken roads at many places, sheer blind turns and tight hairpin bends, which can be exhilarating depending on the state of your nerves. If you are hiring a vehicle then better rent a four wheel drive vehicle from Manali. Some times the local people along with police does not allow the non-four wheel drive vehicles from going beyond Snow-Point(a place 16km before Rohtang Pass)and force to hire their own 4x4 vehicle at exorbitant prices which can be up to \u20b91,500-2,000 per person. This happens in the winter times when there is heavy snow fall. The tours organized by HPTDC does not go up to Rohtang pass and terminate at Snow-Point. Shared taxis are also available.</p>\r\n<p>Rohtang Pass can also be accessed on foot, if there are stoppages beyond Snow-Point. However, it is a strenuous climb and also needs a good guide to show the short cut routes to the Pass.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Beas Kund</strong>, an igloo shaped temple, on top has a spring which is the origin of River Beas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Hadimba Temple:</strong> It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, who was a character in the Indian epic, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The temple is surrounded by a beautiful cedar forest (Dhungri Van Vihar) at the foot of the Him\u0101layas. The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground, which was worshipped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in the year 1553. If you're walking to the temple you can take a short cut up the hill through the woods instead of walking along the road. Look for two signs side by side with vertical Hindi writing on them (blue on the left, green on the right).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Maa Sharvari Temple </strong>This temple is represented as KULDEVI of the kings of Kullu in early times and is worshipped as a manifestation of Durga, and image of the goddess is also enshrined here. The divinity is popularly worshipped throughout the region during the festivals and the Goddess is transported to Kullu to visit the Lord Raghunathji during Dussehra festival. This temple is on the top of above the Shaminallah village, which is around 5km from Manali, accross the Beas river on the left bank on the way to Naggar Casttle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Kalath Hot Water Springs</strong>Around 6.5 Km downstream from Manali, natural sulfurous water flows from the bowels of earth.public bath areas and private bath areas are available.\"Asia Sulphur hot water spring\" is a small hotel where private bathroom can be hired on per-person basis(c. \u20b9100/person). These are simple bathrooms but give all the privacy needed by a couple or family.It can be easily spotted on your way to Manali just before the \"Green Tax barrier\".</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Vashist Hot Water Springs</strong> and Temple: Around 3km from Manali, across the Beas river is Vashist, a small village with natural sulphur springs. Modern bathhouses, with Turkish-style showers, have the hot water piped into them for the convenience of the visitors who come here to benefit from the medicinal properties. Vaishisht, also boasts a pair of old stone temples, opposite each other above the main square. Dedicated to the local patron saint Vashista, the smaller of the two opens on to a partially covered courtyard, and is adorned with elaborate woodcarvings. Those lining the interior of the shrine, blackened by years of oil-lamp and incense smoke, are particularly fine. The temple tanks are underground hot-water/sulfur springs. Be wary of hanging up your trousers or bags on the hooks provided, pickpocketing is a daily occurrence. Hand over your wallet to a trusted person for safekeeping before you enter the springs for a bath. Separate tanks for men and women are provided in the temple. Keep in mind these are open baths and little or no privacy is available for women except separated areas for bathing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Jogini Falls:</strong> About a 2km trek from Vashisth Temple. Going to the top of the falls would need a guide and quite a bit of trekking, but if you wish you could just keep asking for directions from Vashishth temple and reach the first level of the falls.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Solang Valley</strong> popularly known as Snow Point, is 13 km northwest of Manali and famous for its 300m ski lift. The Ski Lift ticket is \u20b9500 per head for a trip both ways. It is a picturesque spot and offers splendid views of glaciers and the snow-capped mountains. Solang valley also offers attractions like paragliding, snorkeling etc. Jagatsukh, the former capital of Manali, is also an important spot.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Jagatsukh:</strong> Jagatsukh, the former capital of Manali, has a few nice temples done in Shikhara style.

There is also the Manu Maharishi Temple, dedicated to sage Manu.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Gauri Shankar Temple</strong> at <strong>DASHAL</strong> village(700m from <strong>Sarsai</strong> ) on the main left bank Kullu Manali Highway. It is a <strong>12th century</strong> protected monument.Also see lush green apple orchards,play with water stream out there</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are some interesting <strong>temples of Tibetan Buddhist lineages</strong> located between old and new Manali.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Naggar:</strong> The Castle, Roerich House and Art gallery are places to see. Moonlight dinner on the balcony of Hotel Castle restaurant is worth experiencing, with the lovely sight of twinkling lights below in the Beas valley. Bijli Mahadev temple, about 20km from Naggar, is also worth visiting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Krishna Temple at Thava:</strong> Ask for directions to this temple from Naggar Castle and do a small trek of half an hour through dense pine and deodar forest to reach the beautiful Krishna Temple. With hardly any tourists around, this place is magical.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Jana Falls:</strong> 15km from Naggar and 35km from Manali, at Zana Village, beautiful Water Fall is worth visiting. The valley provides amazing views. There is one water fall on the road side and two other water falls which are not much explored by tourists and are amazing. Moreover Traditional Himachali food is available here at small hut like shops.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Beautiful Log Hut Area:</strong> In fact both these places especially log hut area have some good hotels to stay.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>The Manali Gompa:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Manali Gompa was built in 1960. It is one of the most important places for Buddhists. Buddhists come to this place from <a title=\"Ladakh\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Ladakh\">Ladakh</a>, Tibet, Spiti, Lahul and Kinnaur. Manali Gompa is world famous for a large statue of Buddha and for its wall paintings.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Kothi:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Kothi is located at the bottom of Rohatang Pass.

It is one of the natural springs of natural water in India. Nehru Kund is named after the late Prime Minister Jawar Lal Nehru. Nehru used to drink water from this Kund, while his journey to Manali. Nehru Kund is on the Manali-Keylong road, about 6 kms from Manali. It is understood that a landslide has wiped out this spring.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Do</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hot natural Sulphur water bath at Kalath(6.5 Km downstream),Vashisht village (3 Km upstream) or Manikaran.</li>\r\n<li>Get your photos clicked with either rabbits or yaks (near the Hadimba Temple). It will cost about \u20b910-20 (USD0.15) for a single photo.</li>\r\n<li>One can also enjoy paddle boating in a fun park near Hadimba temple.</li>\r\n<li>River rafting, skiing, zorbing, trekking, snow scootering, and river crossing. One of the best adventure companies is the High Himalayan Adventure, based in Vashisht village. River rafting is closed during the monsoon season, typically around August 15 to Sept 15. Check the dates if you are interested in doing this. Rafting is an inherently dangerous activity and the record of the various fly by night operators is less than stellar. Fatalities owing to capsizing are fairly common. The rafting outfits also ply their rafts in the winter months, when there isn't much water in the river. Besides the fact that this is not fun, should go overboard and is not rescued immediately, death by hypothermia is certain.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Paragliding</strong>- A word of caution. Many pilots of these parachutes are un-trained and obtain licences in the usual way any licence is obtained in India. Many a tourist visit the Lady Willingdon Mission Hospital with broken bones, sometimes protruding out, and often alive, after accidents. Some paragliders crash into innocent bystanders who end up with spinal injuries (information added by a surgeon who worked at the mentioned hospital. These victims are often treated at the hospital. Serious and complicated cases with heavy blood loss are stabilised to the extent possible and refered to either Chandigarh or Shimla. Some sadly don't make it. Blood availability is very very limited in this hilly area. www.manalihospital.com). Paragliding is quite popular in Manali, especially in the peak season. The scene is located at Solang Valley. There are multiple levels, starting from the basic 1 minute flying for Rs. 450 (the most common), progressing to a more fun 5 minute flight for Rs. 1500. But the ultimate is the half an hour flight for Rs. 2500, for which they take you up almost halfway to Rohtang, and bring you back to Solang all the way by paragliding. In such a long flight, wind plays a big role, and sometimes it is not possible to fly all the way to Solang, something to keep in mind while going for it. Generally, later in the day you go for it, better are the chances you will do the whole flight.<strong>The trip to Hospital, though, may cost you much more than just money!</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Rock climbing</strong>- there are some fabulous routes, however, go with a reputable company that can provide you suitable gear, otherwise this can become a dangerous sport. Look for the bright orange building across from Pizza Olive. The company also does <strong>abseiling</strong> trips, in which you can swing down into 9 tiers of a waterfall using rock-climbing equipment. Another contact is Dave Morahan (9805346007) who takes you to all kind of rock climbing trips for all difficulty levels, and is quite skilled himself.</li>\r\n<li>If interested in books, there is a bookshop in the main town near the Post Office called <strong>Bookworm</strong>. It has a decent selection of books.</li>\r\n<li>Early morning walks as Manali is best enjoyed before the town wakes up</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hiking</strong>- Take the steps behind Himalayan Extreme Centre in Old Manali and follow the footpaths to a beautiful 1-2hrs hike alongside the Manaslu river (much nicer than Jogni falls). You'll have to come back the same way. Swimming possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong>Trekking:</strong></h2>\r\n<p><strong>Deo Tibba Base Camp Trek:</strong> This trek is a technical trekking trail in Manali.

It is accessible from Manali and Shimla. The road from Shimla (via Rekong Peo) is in theory an all-season one, while the Manali road via Rohtang and Kunzum passes is passable only in summer. There is only one Government bus service from Manali to Kaza but the road is pretty inaccessible with frequent landslides along the way. Due to lack of proper roads in this section of the Himalayas, it is advisable to hire a private MUV (Tata Sumos) from Manali to reach Kaza.</p>\r\n<p>Himachal Road Transport Corporation buses link Kaza with Manali and Rekong Peo. The Rekong Peo connection passes through landslide area at Malling Nullah, with transhipment (crossing on foot and being picked up by a bus on another side) being frequently the only way of passing the landslide.</p>\r\n<p>The route from Manali via Losar crossing <strong>Kunzum La</strong> and <strong>Rohtang La</strong> along the <em>Chandra</em> river is perhaps the most beautiful. The road surfaces are very poor - the entire stretch has never been metalled/tarred. But on asking a local person about the road quality, he'd say that the road is a \"good road\". You will have to cross about a score of streams flowing across this State Highway No. 30 which could be about a couple of feet deep.The HP Road Transport bus from Kullu to Kaza via Manali reaches Manali around 4.45AM and leaves at 5.00AM to reach Kaza any time in the afternoon or in the evening on the same day depending upon the road conditions,and it costs you only INR228 oneway per person (as of AUG 2012).</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1> Getting around </h1>\r\n<p>In summer, state transport runs buses through both routes i.e. <a title=\"Manali\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Manali\">Manali</a> - kunzum pass- Kaza and Shimla-Reckongpeo-Sumdo- Kaza. In winters only one bus runs between Reckongpeo and kaza which leaves in early morning to kaza and one bus from Kaza to reckongpeo. Roads are dangerous to drive so if you don't have experience of driving on himalyan roads, don't do it. In winters there are no buses to villages , so only option is to hire a taxi, which is not cheap: every k.m. may cost you 25-40 INR or more ,though it is cheaper than tourist season of summers. The taxi stand has jeeps for hire for fixed rates (listed at the booth).</p>\r\n<p>It is also possible to arrange for a trek, jeep safari, yak safari or mountain biking via the office of Ecosphere, which conducts responsible and volunteer travel trips and tours in the region (info@spitiecosphere.com). It is also common for people to hitch-hike in this mountain terrain, where the locals are extremely friendly and willing to help.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1> Places To See </h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Kye/Ki/Key/Kee</strong> Monastery: This is situated about 20 kms from Kaza. Every visitor is greeted by a complimentary tea. The monks might give a guided tour also. Photography is not allowed inside the prayer rooms but is allowed in the outdoor areas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Komik village</strong>: This is a situated at a height of 4275m. It has a small monastery (women are not allowed inside during prayers). Fossils are also found in this region. The villagers might try to sell the fossils but its probably not legally allowed to buy and transport the fossils.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Kibber village</strong>: Frequently , and wrongly claimed by the locals as the highest village in the region.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sakya Kaza Monastery</strong>: A recently built monastery which was inaugurated on July 9th, 2009 by His Holiness The Dalai Lama.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Dhankar monasteries</strong>: Dhankar is about 40 kms from Kaza in the direction of Peo. You can get there either by a taxi, which will take you all the way up the mountain to the monastery, or by the Himachal Pradesh Road Transport bus (leave at 7AM, return at 3PM from Shichling). The bus will drop you at the junction between Dhankar and Shichling villages. From the Shichling fork, you need to trek nearly 10 kms to get to the monastery by motorable road or by one of the numerous steep mountain trails. There are two gompas at Dhankar village, the much-famed, 1000 year old monastery hidden in the Spitian mountain rocks and the new Gompa, inaugurated recently by the Dalai Lama. The old monastery is literally tethering on the edge and the 60 monks who live in the Gompa are being relocated to the new Gompa until the restoration and reinforcement of the older Gompa is complete. Do visit both the Gomaps if you get a chance. The lamas at the older monastery are very helpful and the inquisitive little Dhankar boys (studying to become lamas) will invariably be more than happy to show you around. If you have a chance to meet the head lama at Dhankar, make sure you grab the opportunity to see him.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Dhankar Lake</strong>: Situated at about an hour's worth of trek from the Dhankar monstery, this lake's pristine waters and surreal location takes you to another place.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1> Things To Do ></h1>\r\n<p>There are a host of activities that can be done in the areas surrounding Kaza. Mountain biking from Manali to Kaza is a popular activity - also popular are numerous trek routes through virgin regions. If you are not in a big group and don't have a pre-arranged tour to Spiti, taxis can be an expensive proposition, especially since no other means of transport is plausible in order to visit the nearby Ki and Komik Gompas. In such a case, a very helpful person who goes by the name of Dorje and who works as a mechanic at the Himachal Pradesh State Bus Shelter, should be called upon. Dorje charges Rs. 150 per person (in 2010) to Komik Gompa as opposed to Rs. 600 that is charged by local cabs for to and fro journeys. Since Dorje is a well loved local, he also provides good information about Spiti and its traditions which can be quite quirky. The only drawback of his cab service to Komik is that you have to spend the night at the Gompa at their guest house which costs Rs. 150. If you have time, it can be a great experience and can get to know quite a few local people who also hitch rides with Dorje since he is reasonably priced. The same cab comes back the next morning with the people back to Kaza.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1> Getting Out </h1>\r\n<p>The State owned road transport bus to Kulu via Manali which plys for 4 to 5 months in summer leaves Kaza bus station at 05.00AM in the morning to reach Manali in the afternoon.Being the only bus in a day to Kulu via Manali it is generally crowded and therefore advisable to have advance reservation for your seat which can be made at the Kaza Bus Station(AUG'2012).

Starting from Manali towards Rohtang Pass and <a title=\"Leh\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Leh\">Leh</a>, you arrive at a junction near Yari-Khoksar. From there, the eastbound road leads to Karcha, Spiti, Kaza, and, after a very long loop, bends southwards to merge into NH22 and continue far south to <a title=\"Shimla\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Shimla\">Shimla</a>. The westwards route from Yari-Khoksar continues as NH21 to Lahaul, <a title=\"Keylong\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Keylong\">Keylong</a>, a string of hairpin bends, and the More Plains, eventually reaching <a title=\"Ladakh\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Ladakh\">Ladakh</a> and Leh.</p>\r\n<p>The passes (Rohtang and Kunzum La)coming from Manali side are usually closed until mid-May, whereas Reckong Peo Pass coming from the Shimla side can usually be traversed year round.</p>\r\n<h2> Access to Spiti </h2>\r\n<p>To enjoy the unspoiled beauty of Spiti, entry from Manali via Rohtang and Kunzum La is ideal, the high altitude desert landscape with virtually no civilisation till Kaza is a sight to behold. There is bus service from Manali to Kaza, subject to weather conditions (open passes), please check with Himachal Roadways at Manali. After passing Rohtang pass (two hour drive from Manali) one away from civilization till next stop at Kaza, eight to ten hours away, On the way one may encounter construction crew working on road or power project and two small road side eating places, First, Chhatru Village with a Government Guest House and four shops where you can get Indian meal of Roti (bread), Rice vegetables and Dal(lentils), and sometimes sandwiches and non-vegetarian dishes. This is last place to stock mineral water and soft-drinks. The other, Batal single hut shop (two in summers) is one hour further down the road offering very basic Indian meal. Highest point on the road is snow covered Kanzum pass (14931 ft), nearly five hours from Rohtang pass, provide breathtaking view of Shigri Glacier. Entire journey and the landscape is a photographer&rsquo;s paradise. Be aware, already poor road will disappear on and off for kilometres but on this virgin landscape, even road is an eyesore. Just before Kaza signs of civilisation reappear. On the way just before the climb of Kanzum La (La means mountain pass) starts at Batal, the road bifurcate for Chandra Tal (approx 10 km/2-3 hours), where basic camping facilities are available and time permitting, deserves a visit especially during full moon. On these roads, distances do not count; duration of your drive will be determined by road conditions and landscape - which will force numerous breaks. No mobile connectivity is available till Kaza which has only BSNL connectivity. (as of August 2013) Unless one is on shoe string budget, it is advisable to hire a SUV from Manali. Nearly all tour operator provide service, prices fluctuate so do bargain and ask for a deal with accommodation Kaza and other places you intend to visit in valley. Insist on a experienced local driver from valley, as they understand the weather and topography, also ensure that SUV is in good condition.</p>\r\n<p>The alternative entry is from Shimla (Capital of Himachal Pradesh) side from <a title=\"Kinnaur\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Kinnaur\">Kinnaur</a> valley which more comfortable all weather road till Kaza, the route is longer and captivating but landscape is typical Himalayan, unlike the route from Manali.

Motorcycles are also an option if you on an Enfield tour, but make sure you're experienced and comfortable on a bike before heading up into these rocky high altitude areas. Another option in some areas is to walk between villages, which can take anywhere from a couple hours to a whole day, and is rewarding in its own way.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Places To See</h1>\r\n<p>Lamas (Monks) are best guide to any Gompa (Monastery), initially they may be a bit reserve, but few questions and a smile will open them up.

Early in the morning is the most scenic &mdash; if the water is still you get a beautiful reflection of the village and mountains in the lake. Follow the path around the left side of the hotel.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Walk around the small village</strong> absorbing the traditional atmosphere and architecture &mdash; it looks like it hasn't changed in hundreds of years.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are some nice <strong>day walks</strong> around the mountains if you're reasonably fit. Behind the lake you can head up the mountain towards the visible <em>chortens</em> which is a nice viewpoint. If you still have a lot more energy continue around to the other side of the range for views east towards <a title=\"Tibet\" href=\"https://wikitravel.org/en/Tibet\">Tibet</a>. In 3 to 4 hours you can reach the village of Tashigang perched high above the Sutlej valley, with an interesting temple. The only things you'll encounter underway are sheephearders and great views.</li>\r\n<li> Nako Monastery, ( In the middle of the village). Allegedly founded by Ringchen Zangpo in 996 AD. A complex of small old temples with fine old sculptures and frescoes, sadly some of them neglected. There's also a new temple built in recent years. Free, donation appreciated. </li>\r\n<li>Gates in the village streets. Built from stone and wood and painted in the inside with colourful Buddhist religious paintings. </li>\r\n</ul>", "tag": "", "population": 0, "male_pc": 0, "female_pc": 0, "total_educated": 0, "male_educated": 0, "female_educated": 0, "is_in_homepage": false, "content_credit": "https://wikitravel.org/en/Nako", "show_demographics": false, "show_hotels": false, "show_video": true, "show_images": true, "category": [2]}}, {"model": "ehimachalapp.destination", "pk": 22, "fields": {"name": "Kangra", "description": "<h1>Get in</h1>\r\n<p>Kangra is around 460km from New Delhi and buses are available which run from New Delhi to Kangra and vice versa.
